Why Redeeming Webroot is Important

If you change or reset your system, your security software might disappear, but your subscription is still valid. Redeeming Webroot means re-activating the license you have already purchased. Without this, your device stays unprotected. Thankfully, Webroot allows easy download, reinstallation, and keycode recovery.

3. Click on the download link, and save the setup file (`wsainstall.exe`) to your computer.
